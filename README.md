## About

**Yanu** is a **Nintendo Switch** ROM updater made to be compatible with Skyline. The supported platforms currently consist of **Android w/Termux**, **Linux** and **Windows**.

The software is to act as sort-of a band-aid until Skyline supports Updates/DLCs natively.

> **Warning** - **Doesn't support DLCs.**

Precompiled binaries are available from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/nozwock/yanu/releases).

### Supported File Types
- [x] NSP 
- [ ] XCI

> **Note** - Support for others might be added.

### Docker
Go [here](https://github.com/nozwock/yanu/pkgs/container/yanu) and pull the container you'd like to use.
Then it can be used as such:
   ```sh
      # Expecting 'prod.keys` in pwd
      docker run -v $(pwd)/prod.keys:/root/.switch/prod.keys -v $(pwd):/work ghcr.io/nozwock/yanu update --base '/path/to/base' --update '/path/to/update' 
   ```

## Usage (CLI only)
View CLI help with:
```sh
yanu --help
```

For updating a ROM:
```sh
yanu --keyfile '/path/to/keyfile' update --base '/path/to/base' --update '/path/to/update'
```

Set a new `Roms Directory` (Used in `update-prompt`) with:
```sh
yanu config --roms-dir '/new/path/here'
```

For unpacking ROMs:
```sh
yanu unpack --base '/path/to/base' --update '/path/to/update'
```

OR, for only unpacking a single ROM:
```sh
yanu unpack --base '/path/to/base'
```

For repacking unpacked ROM data:
```sh
yanu repack --controlnca './base+update.bylies/patchdata/123456.nca' --romfsdir './base+update.bylies/romfs' --exefsdir './base+update.bylies/exefs'
```

> **Note**
> - The above examples were for *nix systems, adapt them appropriately for Windows (Replacing `/` with `\` and with proper path to the executable).
> - Control NCA is usually the NCA around ~1MiB in size.
> - Yanu will only accept Control Type NCA, so you can atleast figure out the Type by trial & error incase it's too hard to guess.
